Problem Statement Title	Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment
Description	Manufacturers are increasingly adopting predictive maintenance strategies to reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency. The objective is to develop a Predictive Maintenance System that can analyze equipment sensor data to predict failures and recommend maintenance schedules, thereby minimizing unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.
Challenges	●	Build a regression or classification model to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment or classify the likelihood of equipment failure.
●	Develop a system that provides recommendations for maintenance schedules based on predictions.
●	Create a dashboard that visualizes equipment status, failure predictions, and maintenance history.
Expected Deliverables	1.	A cleaned and pre-processed dataset ready for modelling.
2.	Demonstrate clearly data storage and transformation process (ETL Pipeline).
3.	A predictive model for estimating equipment failure or remaining useful life (RUL).
4.	A dashboard for monitoring equipment health and providing maintenance recommendations.
